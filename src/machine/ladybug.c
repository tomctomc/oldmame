  Lady Bug doesn't have VBlank interrupts; the software polls port IN0 to
  know when a vblank is happening. Therefore we set a flag here, to let
  ladybug_IN1_r() know when it has to report a vblank.
  Interrupts are still used by the game: but they are related to coin
  slots. Left chute generates an interrupt, Right chute a NMI.
