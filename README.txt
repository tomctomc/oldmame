Usage
-----

MAME [name of the game to run] [options]

for example

MAME mspacman -nosound   will run Ms Pac Man without sound

options:
-noscanlines  use alternate video mode (not availble in all games). Use this
              if the default mode doesn't work with your monitor/video card.
-vesa         use standard 640x480x256 VESA mode instead of custom video mode.
              Use this as a last resort if -noscanlines doesn't solve your
			  video problems.
-soundcard n  select sound card (if this is not specified, you will be asked
              interactively)
-nojoy        don't poll joystick
-log          create a log of illegal memory accesses in ERROR.LOG
-frameskip n  skip frames to speed up the emulation. For example, if the game
              normally runs at 60 fps, "-skipframe 1" will make it run at 30
			  fps, and "-skipframe 2" at 20 fps. Use F11 to check the fps your
			  computer is actually displaying. If the game is too slow,
			  increase the frameskip value. Note that this setting can also
			  affect audio quality (some games sound better, others sound
			  worse).


The following keys work in all emulators:

3       Insert coin
1       Start 1 player game
2       Start 2 players game
Tab     Change dip switch settings
P       Pause
F3      Reset
F4      Show the game graphics. Use cursor keys to change set/color, F4 to exit.
F11     Toggle fps counter
F10     Toggle speed throttling
F12     Save a screen snapshot
ESC     Exit emulator



Pac Man ("pacman")
------------------

Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode
CTRL    Speed up cheat

Clones supported:
  Pac Man modification ("pacmod")
  Namco Pac Man ("namcopac")
  Hangly Man ("hangly")
  Puck Man ("puckman")
  Piranha ("piranha")

Known issues:
- Blinky and Pinky seem to be shifted one pixel to the right. This is really
  annoying, but I can't seem to be able to understand why. Maybe there is an
  additional "sprite offset" register somewhere? Or did the original just
  behave this way?
  Note that we can't fix it by just moving sprites 0 and 1 one pixel to the
  left, because when Pac Man eats a power pill the sprites order is changed
  so that Pac Man is drawn over the ghosts. It becomes sprite 0, and Blinky
  becomes sprite 4.



Ms Pac Man ("mspacman")
-----------------------

Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode
CTRL    Speed up cheat

Crush Roller ("crush")
----------------------

Crush Roller is a hacked version of Make Trax, modified to run on a
Pac Man board.

Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level

Known issues:
- There's the same problem with sprites as in Pac Man, but here it could be
  fixed without apparent side effects.



Pengo ("pengo")
---------------

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Push
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode

Clones supported:
  Penta ("penta")



Lady Bug ("ladybug")
--------------------

Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level

Known issues:
- The noise generator is not emulated yet.



Mr. Do! ("mrdo")
----------------

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Fire
F1      Skip level
CTRL+F3 Test mode

Clones supported:
  Mr. Lo! ("mrlo")

Known issues:
- The noise generator is not emulated yet, but I think Mr. Do! doesn't
  use it anyway.



Crazy Climber ("cclimber")
--------------------------

E,S,D,F Left joystick
I,J,K,L Right joystick
F1      Skip level

Clones supported:
  Japanese version ("ccjap")
  bootleg version ("ccboot")



Crazy Kong ("ckong")
--------------------

This Donkey Kong clone runs on the same hardware as Crazy Climber, most
notable differencies being a larger character set and the display rotated
90 degrees.

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Jump

Known issues:
- Some problems with sound



Donkey Kong ("dkong")
--------------------

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Jump



Donkey Kong Jr. ("dkongjr")
---------------------------

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Jump



Bagman ("bagman")
-----------------

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Action

Known issues:
- Frequent slowdowns, I don't know what's causing them (the fps counter stays
  at 60, so this is not caused by slow emulation).



Wizard of Wor ("wow")
---------------------

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Fire
F2      Test mode (keep it pressed)
The original machine had a special joystick which could be moved either
partially or fully in a direction. Pushing it slightly would turn around the
player without moking it move. The emulator assumes that you are always
pushing the joystick fully, to simulate the "half press" you can press Alt.


Known issues:
- This game is completely different from anything else I have emulated before.
  The video memory is bitmapped. There are no character generator ROMs,
  graphics data is contained in the code ROMs and the program sends commands
  to some custom circuitry on the board to do copies, fills, and so on.
  Understanding how the thing works without the schematics is tricky. There
  are no memory mapped ports, everything is done via IN and OUT instructions.
  As of now, it is somewhat playable but there are several faults.
- No background stars, no fade in/fade out.


The Adventures of Robby Roto ("robby")
--------------------------------------

This game runs on the same hardware as Wizard of Wor, but doesn't work yet. I
still haven to check the loading address of the ROMs.



Gorf ("gorf")
--------------------------------------

This game runs on the same hardware as Wizard of Wor, but doesn't work yet.
It boots, shows some text on the screen and that's all.



Galaxian ("galaxian")
---------------------

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Fire
F2      Test mode

There are so many clones here that I'm not even sure which is the "original"
one. The dip switch menu might display wrong settings.
  Namco Galaxian ("galnamco")
  Super Galaxian ("superg")
  Galaxian Part X ("galapx")
  Galaxian Part 1 ("galap1")
  Galaxian Part 4 ("galap4")

Known issues:
- I haven't yet had time to check what the various input bits and dip switches
  do. Two players are not supported.
- Is this game supposed to have background stars?

bullets are not vertical lines and the star background doesn't scroll.

Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Fire
ALT     Bomb

Clones supported:
  Battle of Atlantis ("atlantis") [I don't know what most of the dip switches
                                   do, and you get 9 credits per coin.]

Known issues:
- The background stars don't blink. Maybe they should also be clipped to the top

CTRL    Fire



Bomb Jack ("bombjack")
----------------------

Arrows  Move around

Press fire to skip the ROM/RAM test at the beginning.

In the dip switch menu, DIFFICULTY 1 refers to the speed of the mechanical
bird, while DIFFICULTY 2 to the number and speed of enemies.

Known issues:
- Colors are accurate, but not entirely: the original machine uses 12 bits
  (4 bits per pen), while I currently use only 8 bits (3 bits for red and
  green, 2 bits for blue).
- Is the sprite priority correct? For example, during the demo, should GAME
  OVER be in front or behind other sprites?
  There is another bit in the sprite attributes which I don't know what means:
  it seems to be set only when the (B) materializes.
- For the DIFFICULTY 2 setting, EASY and MEDIUM might be swapped. Anyone can
  confirm?
- The INITIAL HIGH SCORE setting doesn't only set that, it does something
  else as well - but I don't know what.
